# Digital Design & Computer Architecture Odyssey: Spring 2023

Diving Deep into Digital Design &amp; Comp Arch Spring 2023 - My exploration of digital circuits and computer architecture, from the ground up. Follow my journey as I decode the design of modern microprocessors and embrace the hardware/software symphony!

## üéØ Course Objectives Unpacked

This journey is not just about learning; it's about understanding the very fabric of computing:

- **The Basics**: We're not just scratching the surface; we're digging deep into the electrons of digital circuits.
- **The Principles**: Discovering the laws that govern the architecture of computing, guiding our path to creating efficient, robust designs.
- **The Precedents**: Standing on the shoulders of giants, we explore the landmarks in computer architecture that shape our modern computing landscape.

And through this exploration, we aim to:

- Decode the inner workings of a modern computer.
- Weigh the scales of design trade-offs.
- Craft our very own microprocessor design.
- Hone our debugging skills on increasingly complex systems.
- Dare to dream up novel, innovative designs that push the boundaries.

## üõ† What's Inside This Repo

- **Class Notes**: Take a peek into every lecture's & reading's discoveries, challenges, and eureka moments.
- **Project Showcase**: Witness the birth of a microprocessor, from conception to implementation.
- **Design Trade-offs**: Delve into the critical decisions that shape the future of computing.
- **Resource Library**: A curated collection of external resources that have illuminated my path.

## üåå Goals of This Galactic Quest

- To build a solid foundation in the principles of digital design and computer architecture.
- To transition from a theoretical understanding to practical, hands-on design and debugging prowess.
- To contribute to the community of future architects who will design the computing platforms of tomorrow.
- To document the journey, not just the destination, fostering a space for reflection and growth.
